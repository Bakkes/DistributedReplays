/**
 * This clock provides a simple callback system that keeps track of elapsed and delta time
 * transformations. This makes it extremely easy to parse the deltas of a replay by their frame
 * count, and maintain a real-time comparison against those frames. Primarily to be used by the
 * THREE.js animation system and communicate changes back to the parent container of animations so
 * that we can display data which is recorded at a frame and not at a time.
 *
 * When constructing this object, you should provide an array of elapsed durations, where each
 * index in the array represents the time since the beginning of the animation. The first index, 0,
 * should be set to 0 (the elapsed time since the start), followed by these times. For example:
 * 0: 0
 * 1: 0.0483877919614315
 * 2: 0.08385848999023438
 * 3: 0.13224628567695618
 * 4: 0.18096305429935455
